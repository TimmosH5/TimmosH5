Hangman is a simple game in which you get a word presented to you in _ symbols, so you only know the length of the word.
Then you get guesses - if correctly guessed you'll stay in the level you're in, and you see your correct guess so you won't 
guess that letter again. Simple error handling is provided.

If incorrect, the hangman progresses into its next level.
