The Contact Manager is a simple file creating the logic for adding contacts to an application. 
Every Contact is an object with getters & setters and is a simple OOP exercise.

It showcases the understanding of Arraylists and handles updating with a simple terminal user interface
that asks for getting contacts and updating contacts, as well as creating contacts.
